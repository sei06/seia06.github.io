<p> Hi, I'm Youssif! I recently began my undergraduate studies at Stanford University majoring in computer science. I'm excited about mathematics, 
  macroeconomics and the markets and I'm passionate about building things that can make an impact at scale.</p>
<p> In the past, I've been interested in hardware and electronics. I spent this past summer at the MIT Media Lab as part of the Fluid Interfaces Group (led by Prof Pattie Maes), 
  working on <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/attentivu/overview/">AttentivU</a>, a device, in the form factor of a pair of glasses that senses brain activity (through EEGs)
  and eye movements to measure and respond to different cognitive processes in real time.
  During my time in the Media Lab I built 2 new version of AttentivU with new magnetic hinges that reduced the device’s failure rate during field testing as well as
  presented the lab’s work at MIT Augmenting Brains Conference in the MIT Museum. </p>
<p> This work was inspired by my past augmented reality research,
  for which I was incredibly fortunate to have worked on a healthcare startup Vound, developing wearable headsets for the hearing impaired.
  I began working on building headset prototypes serving the deaf population through augmented reality wearable devices and speech recognition
  software that interprets audio signals and converts them into projections in real-time. We received MIT Enterprise Forum (3rd Place winner);
  Harvard Arab Startup Competition (2nd Place); Microsoft Imagine Cup (2nd place); Intel Global Challenge (1st Place) and 1776 World Cup (top 3 startups). </p>
